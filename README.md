## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpk1212/EdgeFinder.git
cd EdgeFinder
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Edit the lineups in `statcast_preview.py`:
```python
team1 = [
    {'name': 'Player Name', 'position': 'POS'},
    # Add more players...
]

team2 = [
    {'name': 'Player Name', 'position': 'POS'},
    # Add more players...
]
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python statcast_preview.py
```

3. The script will generate a `game_preview.png` file with the visualization.

The generated preview includes:
- Team names and lineups
- Advanced Statcast metrics for each player
- Color-coded performance indicators:
  - Red: Above average performance
  - White: Average performance
